#  ASSIGNMENT 3 Almond Yields

## Conceptual model 

![Almond yield conceptual model](almond_conceptual_model.png)

The yield modelling equation was sourced from Lobell et al., 2006. The function is located in an R script and called below to identify the maximum, minimum, and mean almond yields based on climate inputs from 1988 to 2010.

```{r}
# load in appropriate libraries
library(tidyverse)
library(purrr)
library(here)
```

```{r}
# read in data
 clim_data <- read.table("../../Data/clim.txt",
                    header = TRUE, sep = " ")

#source the almond yield function
source(here("Assignments/assignment3/almond-yield-function.R"))
```


```{r}
# view data structure
head(clim_data)
```
```{r}
# run the almond yields function on the clim_data
almond_yields <- almond_yield(clim_data)

# output the return values
almond_yields
```
